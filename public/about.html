<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Christodoulos (Chris for short), and I am 41 years old. I’m a dad of two wonderful children and
   work full-time as an air force pilot. As you can imagine, my secret passion is computers. I recently started 
   learning HTML coding, and I’m so excited about it!</p>

<p>My next step is to become a junior web developer and, why not, start working on some small projects! I am full
   of hope that one day I will become a competitive web developer and earn an income from this activity. I am willing
    to invest my time and effort into gaining knowledge in this field!</p>
